    type: "Energy demand",
    desc: "The main purpose of project is distribution of fuel-efficient improved cook stoves (ICS) in India. The ICS disseminated through this project will replace the low efficient baseline cook stoves. Through this project, the distribution and installation of high thermal efficient improved cook stoves (ICS) will be undertaken for households and communities/non-household. The ICS will burn wood more efficiently thereby improving thermal energy transfer to pots, hence saving fuel wood and greenhouse gases. Not only will this halt the rapidly progressing deforestation but will also reduce health hazards from indoor air(smoke) pollution and women and children will have to spend less time in collecting firewood."

    desc: "TheUS Beef CowCredit project (Multiple Instances of Project Activities and multiple US states) aims to involve the US Beef industry with the purpose to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the livestock sector. The project activity introduces Mootral® natural feed supplement into beef diet aiming to reduce methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation by direct inhibition of methanogens in the rumen. This process results in a substantial net reduction of GHG emissions, because of the avoidance of CH4 released into the atmosphere, which would occur under normal operating circumstances (“the business as usual”). Over the 10 years of the first crediting period, the project will generate an estimated annual average reduction of 300'000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)."

    desc: "The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Yangxin County within Huangshi City, Hubei Province of China, with a total acreage of 13,141 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission removal than the continuously flooded."

    type: "Energy demand",
    desc: "The intention of the grouped project activity involves the installation of low greenhouse gas emitting safe drinking water purifiers (SDWPs) to provide clean drinking water to the households of Laos. The grouped project activity reduces the use and demand for fossil fuels and non-renewable biomass that would have been used to boil water as a means to purify water in the absence of this project activity. This directly leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, it can be helpful to user`s health. The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project is the actual baseline scenario which is equal to the existing common practice by the households i.e. in absence of the project activity the equivalent amount of thermal energy generated using firewood in three stone open fires to meet the boiling water demand."
